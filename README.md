# KSA205
 
Translating matlab script to python.

Instructions to install VS Code (editor), conda (python package manager) and the python environment for the course can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/julia-neme/KSA205/wiki).

Questions:
 - `PyCO2SYS` should probably be tested. There are several functions available and I'm not sure I selected the correct one. 
 - In week 9, all the work with Argo floats is done using the library `argopy`. This allows to easily open data (from a regin or a single float ID) and plot it using one line of code. No need for a function to download using ftp or anything like that.
